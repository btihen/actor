Actor Messaging
===============

Implementation of the actor computational model for ruby.

*NOTE*: Documentation is incomplete

== Basic Usage

=== Installation

To install `actor` via rubygems.org, you will have to refer to the gem as `ntl-actor` when running `gem install` or adding the gem to Bundler.

[source,sh]
----
gem install ntl-actor
----

Bundler:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'ntl-actor', require: 'actor'
----

If you add `https://repo.fury.io/ntl/` to your list of gem sources, you can install the library by its proper name:

[source,sh]
----
gem install actor
----

Bundler:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'actor'
----

=== Defining an Actor

[source,ruby]
----
class Factorial
  include Actor

  attr_reader :number, :reply_address

  def initialize number, reply_address
    @number, @reply_address = number, reply_address
  end

  handle :start do
    if number == 1
      reply 1
    else
      Factorial.start number - 1, address
    end
  end

  handle :result do |previous_result|
    value = previous_result.value * number

    reply value
  end

  def reply value
    result = Result.new value, number

    send.(result, reply_address)

    :stop
  end

  Result = Struct.new :value, :number do
    include Actor::Messaging::Message
  end
end
----

=== Starting an Actor

[source,ruby]
----
result_address = Actor::Messaging::Address.build

Factorial.start 42, result_address

result = Actor::Messaging::Read.(result_address)

puts "fac(42) = #{result.value}"
----

=== Handling Custom Messages

You can send _any_ ruby object that includes `Actor::Messaging::Message` to the actor with `Actor::Messaging::Send`; though mutable objects aren't recommended, as messages will be read by other threads. Handlers can be defined for those messages through the `handle` class macro on the Actor class. The class of the message is generally passed to `handle`, but an underscore cased symbol can be used as well. For example:

[source,ruby]
----
class SomeActor
  include Actor

  # ...

  handle :some_message do |message|
    # do something
  end

  handle OtherMessage do |message|
    # do something else
  end
end

# Start an actor and send a custom message to it
address = Actor.start

Actor::Messaging::Send.(SomeMessage.new, address)
Actor::Messaging::Send.(OtherMessage.new, address)
----

Also, every Actor comes equipped with a `send` dependency which is just an instance of `Actor::Messaging::Send`. When any actor is instantiated directly through its `initialize` method, the send dependency is an inert substitute. When the actor is constructed through the `.start` class method, the send dependency will actually deliver messages to other actors.

=== Errors

When an actor raises an error, its thread immediately stops, but the rest of the ruby program remains unaffected. If you call `#join` on the thread object returned by `.start`, the error will be re-raised. The actor will not restart itself or deliver an exception notification. When using a supervisor (see below), any errors raised by actors will be re-raised by the supervisor. It should go without saying that errors are undesirable and Actor makes no effort to make them easier to work with. "_Don't_ let it crash" is the idea.

=== Supervisor

In production, actors are best run within the context of a supervisor that keeps track of all actors, watches out for crashed actors, and gracefully shuts down actors when it's time to stop the show. See `examples/interactive.rb` for an example. Here is a snippet extracted from that file:

[source,ruby]
----
Actor::Supervisor.start do |supervisor|
  InteractiveExample::Prompt.start

  Signal.trap 'INT' do
    puts "\n\n** Received SIGINT; shutting down supervisor **\n\n"
    Actor::Messaging::Send.(:shutdown, supervisor.address)
  end
end
----

=== Version Scheme

Actor follows a version scheme with three numbers separated by dots, similar to SemVer, but the numbers have a slightly different meaning. The first number indicates the major product version, or epoch. The second number is increased for breaking changes, otherwise the third number is increased.
