Actor
=====

Implementation of actor pattern for ruby designed for simplicity and frugality.

NOTE: Documentation is incomplete.

== Basic Usage

=== Installation

To install +actor+ via rubygems.org, you will have to refer to the gem as +ntl-actor+ when running +gem install+ or adding the gem to Bundler.

[source,sh]
----
gem install ntl-actor
----

Bundler:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'ntl-actor', require: 'actor'
----

If you add +https://repo.fury.io/ntl/+ to your list of gem sources, you can install the library by its proper name:

[source,sh]
----
gem install actor
----

Bundler:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'actor'
----

=== Defining an Actor

[source,ruby]
----
class Fizzbuzz
  include Actor

  def initialize stop_position
    @stop_position = stop_position

    @position = 0
  end

  # When the actor is running, this method will be executed in rapid succession
  # by an infinite loop.
  def action
    @position += 1

    output = String.new

    output << 'Fizz' if @position % 3 == 0
    output << 'Buzz' if @position % 5 == 0
    output << @position.to_s if output.empty?

    puts output

    if @position == @stop_position
      puts "Done!"
      # Raising StopIteration anywhere in this method will cause both the actor
      # (self) and the thread executing it to terminate.
      raise StopIteration 
    end
  end
end
----

=== Starting an Actor

[source,ruby]
----
# Thread will be started in the background. An instance of Fizzbuzz will count
# up to 1000.
Fizzbuzz.start 1000

# Sleep will ensure the ruby script doesn't exit before Fizzbuzz finishes
sleep 1
----

=== Terminating an Actor

The simplest way for an actor to be terminated is for it to raise a +StopIteration+ exception when it is done. However, many actors are designed to run indefinitely, and thus need to be terminated by another actor. This can be achieved through sending a message that (eventually) _tells_ the actor to stop.

All actors are assigned a unique address when they are started. You can write messages to this address and control its execution. The address is returned by the +.start+ method, and you can send the actor a stop message by writing an instance of +Actor::Message::Stop+ to the address. When the actor eventually handles this message, it will stop running and its surrounding thread will terminate.

[source,ruby]
----
address = FizzBuzz.start 1000

stop_message = Actor::Message::Stop.new

Actor::Messaging::Writer.write stop_message, address
----

Of course, while this will cause the actor to stop _fairly soon_, it won't be immediate.

To wait for an actor to actually terminate, you'll want to call +Thread#join+ on the the thread spawned by this library. To do so, you will need access to the +Thread+ instance that is running the actor. You can cause the +.start+ method to return the thread with a special +include+ parameter:

[source,ruby]
----
address, thread = FizzBuzz.start 1000, include: %i(thread)

# See instantiation of stop_message above
Actor::Messaging::Writer.write stop_message, address

# Ruby will block until the thread terminates
thread.join
----

You can also cause +.start+ to return the instance of the actor, e.g.

[source,ruby]
----
address, thread, actor = FizzBuzz.start 1000, include: %i(thread actor)
----

The Actor instance should not be used outside of testing purposes, as communication across thread boundaries is meant to be achieved by passing messages through the actor's address.

=== Messages Handled Internally

In addition to +Actor::Message::Stop+, there are other messages defined internally by Actor. +Pause+ and +Resume+ will cause the actor to pause and resume execution in between successive invocations of +action+. +RecordStatus+ will instruct an Actor to report some statistical information as well as general status. That message requires a reply address to be specified, which can be obtained via calling +Actor::Messaging::Address.get+. The reply can then be read by instantiating a reader for the reply address.

[source,ruby]
----
reply_address = Actor::Messaging::Address.get
reply_reader = Actor::Messaging::Reader.build reply_address

record_status = Actor::Message::RecordStatus.new reply_address

Actor::Messaging::Writer.write record_status, address

# Wait for the reply to be issued by the actor
status_reply = reply_reader.read wait: true

# Query e.g. the number of times #action has been executed
status_reply.executions
----

NOTE: Make sure at least one reader is constructed before writing any message to an address, as messages that are written to addresses without any readers are dropped in order to prevent memory leaks. Every actor uses a reader for handling messages, so this is a concern when using addresses returned by +Actor::Messaging::Address.get+. Also note that an address is a resource, and must be stopped via the +#stop+ method when it is no longer needed.

=== Handling Custom Messages

You can send _any_ ruby object to the actor with +Actor::Messaging::Writer+; though mutable objects aren't recommended, as messages will be read by other threads. Those messages can be handled by implementing +handle+ on the Actor class.

[source,ruby]
----
class SomeActor
  include Actor

  # ...

  def handle message
    case message
    when SomeMessage then do_something
    when OtherMessage then do_something_else
    end
  end
end

# Start an actor and send a custom message to it
address = Actor.start

Actor::Messaging::Writer.write SomeMessage.new, address
----

System messages can additionally be handled via the +handle+ method, and they will not interfere with the normal internal handling of such messages.

=== Errors

When an actor raises an error, its thread immediately stops, but the rest of the ruby program remains unaffected. If you call +#join+ on the thread object returned by +.start+, the error will be re-raised. It is recommended to keep track of actors by starting them from within a +ThreadGroup+ and periodically joining each of the actor threads. The actor will not restart itself or deliver an exception notification. It should go without saying that errors are undesirable and Actor makes no effort to make them easier to work with. "_Don't_ let it crash" is the idea.

=== Version Scheme

Actor follows a version scheme with three numbers separated by dots, similar to SemVer, but the numbers have a slightly different meaning. The first number indicates the major product version, or epoch. The second number is increased for breaking changes, otherwise the third number is increased.
